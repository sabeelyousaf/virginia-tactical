    <h3>COMPLIANCE</h3>

    <h4>FIREARM PURCHASING</h4>
    <p>All firearm acquisitions, whether made in a physical store, through online transactions, via private party transfers, or from another Federal Firearms License (FFL) dealer, are subject to a comprehensive background check procedure in accordance with Virginia Law when conducted at Virginia Tactical Shooting Academy. Once your order has been received, processed, and is ready for pickup, we will promptly get in touch with you.</p>
    <p>Please ensure that you furnish precise and up-to-date contact information when placing your orders. The individual whose name is listed on the transfer slip must undergo the background check process. NO EXCEPTIONS.</p>

    <h4>STATE AND OUT OF STATE PURCHASING</h4>
    <p>Kindly note that to facilitate any background checks or purchases involving pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns, or lower receivers, you will be required to possess a valid Virginia state identification card or Virginia driver's license, or you must establish your residency in Virginia.</p>
    <p>For individuals residing outside of Virginia, please be aware that you can solely acquire rifles and shotguns with a barrel length exceeding 16 inches. It's imperative to acknowledge that firearms transactions for out-of-state residents are subject to the firearm laws of their respective home state. In most cases, regardless of the firearm category, out-of-state firearm purchases are typically mandated to be processed through a Federal Firearms License (FFL) holder in your residing state. It is vital to thoroughly review your state's firearm laws before initiating any purchase.</p>
    <p>To adhere to federal regulations, individuals must be at least 21 years old to purchase firearms falling under the 16-inch barrel length category, which includes pistols, revolvers, and receivers. In Virginia, it's important to note that residents aged 18 and older have the privilege to purchase rifles or shotguns with a barrel length exceeding 16 inches. However, individuals in the age range of 18 to 20 should be aware that their purchase requests will automatically enter an "In Research" status, and it may take up to 10 business days to receive a response from the Virginia State Police. Rest assured that we will promptly contact you with the final status once it is updated on the Virginia Tactical Shooting Academy's side.</p>
